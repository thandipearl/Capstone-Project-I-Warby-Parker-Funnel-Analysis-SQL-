##  Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Understand user behavior across Warby Parkerâ€™s marketing funnels.
- Identify where users drop off in the quiz funnel.
- Compare conversion rates in the Home Try-On (HTO) funnel, especially across different A/B test groups (3 pairs vs. 5 pairs).
- Derive actionable business insights to improve conversion and user experience.

##  Data Description

##  Key Insights

###  Quiz Funnel Completion Rates

| Question                          | Responses | Completion % |
|----------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| What are you looking for?        | 500       | 100.00%       |
| What's your fit?                 | 475       | 95.00%        |
| How old are you?                 | 380       | 76.00%        |
| Which colors do you like?        | 361       | 72.20%        |
| When was your last eye exam?     | 270       | 54.00%        |

**Insight:** Completion rates drop significantly after the second question, with the final question seeing only 54% completion. Personal or health-related questions may discourage users.

| 3 Pairs          | 53.03%         |
| 5 Pairs          | 79.25%         |

##  Actionable Recommendations

1. **Shorten the quiz** by removing or rephrasing personal questions like age or last eye exam.
2. **Default to 5-pair try-on** for most users to maximize conversion.
3. **Retarget users who drop off** during the quiz via email reminders or remarketing.
4. **A/B test a shorter quiz version** to improve entry into the funnel.
